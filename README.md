Algorithm Overview
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns in data. Isolation Forest is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for anomaly detection. It works by isolating the observations that are different from the majority of the data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this implementation is the medical_data_csv from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit card users and is labeled as either fraud or normal.

Results
The algorithm is able to successfully detect anomalies in the data with a high degree of accuracy.
 The results can be visualized using a scatter plot of the data points with the anomalies highlighted in red.

Conclusion
This implementation of Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection provides a simple and effective way to detect anomalies in data. 
The algorithm can be easily adapted to work with other datasets as well.
